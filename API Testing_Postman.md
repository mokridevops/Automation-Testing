# API Testing using Postman


Postman - manual testing of postman

basics of Java script - postman by default supports JavaScript language - in the response.

little bit of automation is also involved in postman, we can run some tests multiple number of times.

Postman - available in two flavors:
1) Desktop
2) Web


Everything of our activities in Postman will be saved in Cloud

we can still store our collections and data in local desktop too!  for both above - we have to create an Account!



Install Postman

1) Workspace - create, rename, delete - a place where we can store 
2) Collection - create a collection: folder - where a group of requests are stored
   
   create, rename, delete - run the collection

   - we can create any number of collections

     Request --> API --> Response

4 types of HTTP requests:
