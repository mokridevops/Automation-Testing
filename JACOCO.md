Code Coverage: Is how much percentage of code that is covered by our automation testing

This is the white box testing - to verify the internal workings of the software, ensuring all the code paths, conditions, and loops are tested. (Usually this will be unit tests covered by the Developers).

Black box testing - it is mainly the functional testing, without the knowledge of the internal structure, design or code.
