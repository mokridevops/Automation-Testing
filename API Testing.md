# Types of API: 4 types:

1) Open APIs (PUblic APIs): Open to public - everyone can use - ex: google maps API
2) Internal APIs (Private APIs): within company or organization
3) Partner APIs: shared with specific partners or businesses - ex: 1) google providing mapsAPI to ola or uber etc, 2) kayak.com - all airlines gives permission to kayak to use their data through API, so these are called partner APIs
4) Composite APIs:  combine multiple APIs into one call, allows get you data from different source in a single request.  - ex: ecommerce application - product info, price info, reviews info, etc - 3 different APIs called together and get data together at the same time.

# API vs WebService vs MicroService

API not available on online - is an API

API available on online - is a WebService

So, all WebServices are API's, but not all WebServices are not API's



Microservice: a small component in an application

If we have multiple microservices and they communicating with each other - using APIs

so API is acting as an interface for communication of two microservices
