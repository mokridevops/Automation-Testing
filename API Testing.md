# Types of API: 4 types:

1) Open APIs (PUblic APIs): Open to public - everyone can use - ex: google maps API
2) Internal APIs (Private APIs): within company or organization
3) Partner APIs: shared with specific partners or businesses - ex: 1) google providing mapsAPI to ola or uber etc, 2) kayak.com - all airlines gives permission to kayak to use their data through API, so these are called partner APIs
4) Composite APIs:  combine multiple APIs into one call, allows get you data from different source in a single request.  - ex: ecommerce application - product info, price info, reviews info, etc - 3 different APIs called together and get data together at the same time.

# API vs WebService vs MicroService

API not available on online - is an API

API available on online - is a WebService

So, all WebServices are API's, but not all WebServices are not API's



Microservice: a small component in an application

If we have multiple microservices and they communicating with each other - using APIs

so API is acting as an interface for communication of two microservices

SOAP API - only xml format
Rest API - many formats


# Rest API HTTP Methods:

Request Message -> Application Program Interface (API) -> Response Message

HTTP Request (get, post, put, patch, delete)

Validations Performed (Response Status Code, Data, etc.)


Different types of API requests : HTTP Requests: get, post, put, patch, delete

get - retrieve from server 
post - sending /create something in server
put - update something in server
patch - updating the existing data in server
delete - delete the existing data in server

these are similar to CRUD - create, udpate, read and delete, but on http are : get, post, put,patch, delete
